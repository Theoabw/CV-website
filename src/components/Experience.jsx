                    In my current role at Datateknologerna vid Åbo Akademi rf, I am responsible for maintaining,
                    developing, and enhancing our student association's websites. My work involves using Django, a
                    high-level Python web framework, to ensure our websites are not only functional but also
                    user-friendly. I manage GitHub pull requests, streamline server operations, and implement feature
                    upgrades. This role allows me to apply my technical skills in a real-world setting, ensuring I
                    continually grow as a developer.

                    operations of the store. Working in this fast-paced environment, I developed strong communication

                    At Eriksberg Manor, I was involved in various maintenance tasks, including gardening and general
                    upkeep. This role required a hands-on approach and attention to detail. My responsibilities included
                    maintaining the aesthetic and functional aspects of the manor, which taught me the value of hard
                    work and the importance of maintaining high standards in all tasks.
