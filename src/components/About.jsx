                    Hello, I’m Theo Wilenius, a 21-year-old computer engineering student at Åbo Akademi University. My
                    interest in technology is straightforward: I enjoy solving problems and learning new things in the
                    field of programming and data analytics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My academic background includes a high school education at Katedralskolan i Åbo and an exchange year
                    at Baltimore Polytechnic Institute in the USA. These experiences have broadened my perspective and
                    strengthened my problem-solving skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professionally, I have a diverse range of experiences. I've worked in landscaping and maintenance at
                    Eriksberg Manor and in customer service at S-market Tupuri. Each role has taught me valuable lessons
                    in teamwork and adaptability. Currently, I am a Web Developer & Administrator for Datateknologerna
                    vid Åbo Akademi rf, where I manage and enhance our student association’s websites using Django. This
                    role allows me to blend my interest in technology with practical skills in web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my studies and work, I served as the Treasurer for the student union at
                    Katedralskolan i Åbo and completed military service leadership training with Uudenmaan prikaati.
                    These experiences have honed my organizational and leadership skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am fluent in Finnish, Swedish, and English, and my technical skills include Python, Java, SQL,
                    Docker, QEMU, and Linux. I am always eager to learn more and apply my skills in new and challenging
                    contexts.
                </p>
